    <h1>TASTEBUDDIN</h1>
    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>This is Tastebuddin, an all new app that can help you find the perfect recipes for you.</p>
    <p>Finding recipes right before dinner can be difficult, and 
        prepping days in advance can be laborious. Plus, sharing recipes 
        with friends and families and making connections through food feels 
        like something only a food blogger can do. Tastebuddin changes that, 
        allowing for all users to contribute while sporting a 
        simplistic design to help users discover and curate collections of recipes.</p> <!-- Taken from SDS -->
